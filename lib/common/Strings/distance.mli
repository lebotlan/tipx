val edit_distance : string -> string -> int -> int option
(** [edit_distance a b cutoff] computes the edit distance between
    strings [a] and [b]. To help efficiency, it uses a cutoff: if the
    distance [d] is smaller than [cutoff], it returns [Some d], else
    [None].

    The distance algorithm currently used is Damerau-Levenshtein: it
    computes the number of insertion, deletion, substitution of
    letters, or swapping of adjacent letters to go from one word to the
    other. The particular algorithm may change in the future.

(* prefix indicates how many prefix chars must be unchanged (0 by default) *)
val spellcheck: ?prefix:int -> string list -> string -> string list
(** [spellcheck env name] takes a list of names [env] that exist in
    the current environment and an erroneous [name], and returns a
    list of suggestions taken from [env], that are close enough to
    [name] that it may be a typo for one of them. *)

(* It is a list of all candidates at the same (shortest) distance *)
